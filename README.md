# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This website allows the user to input a city and get the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity as well as a 5 day weather forecast for that city. The user's search history is saved locally for ease of access later in the form of a dynamically created button. 

This project uses Bootstrap for the initial styling as well as CSS for more specified styling. It mainly uses JQUERY for the localStorage, dynamically changing elements, and button presses. This uses the One Call API as well as the Geocoding API from OpenWeather in order to get the location and current weather from the given city name.


### User Story

### Acceptance Criteria
